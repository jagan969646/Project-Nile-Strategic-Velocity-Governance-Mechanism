# Amazon Day-1 Analytics Engine – Problem Statement

Amazon faces three major strategic risks:

## 1. Organizational Inefficiency
Rapid expansion created excessive management layers, slowing decision making.
Goal: Optimize span of control and reduce bureaucracy.

## 2. AI Capital Expenditure Risk
Heavy AI infrastructure spending requires visibility into ROI and utilization.
Goal: Track revenue yield and free cash flow impact.

## 3. Marketplace Compliance Risk
Dual role as platform and seller creates regulatory pressure.
Goal: Monitor pricing deltas to avoid unfair competition.

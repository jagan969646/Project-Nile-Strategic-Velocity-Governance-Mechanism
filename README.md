🏗️ The Problem Statement: "Amazon's Day 1 Crisis"
The Bureaucracy Tax: Identifying and removing middle-management layers to return to a 10:1 IC-to-Manager ratio.

The $200B AI Gamble: Correlating record-breaking CapEx with real-time AWS utilization to protect Free Cash Flow (FCF).

The Regulatory Siege: Monitoring "Price Deltas" and algorithmic biases to mitigate FTC and EU antitrust risks before the Oct 2026 trials.

🛠️ Strategic Modules & Features
1. CapEx ROI Sentinel (Finance & AI)
The Mechanism: Correlates infrastructure spend ($200B pipeline) with real-time server utilization.

Business Impact: Prevents "infrastructure hemorrhaging" by identifying under-utilized clusters, allowing for dynamic capital reallocation.

Metric Tracked: AWS Revenue Yield per TTM CapEx.

2. Operational Velocity Dashboard (Org Health)
The Mechanism: An autonomous auditor for "Span of Control" (SoC).

Business Impact: Identifies organizational "pockets of decay" where management layers exceed the 10:1 mandate, reducing annual OpEx by an estimated 12-15%.

Metric Tracked: Inefficiency Score (IC:Manager Ratio).

3. Antitrust Compliance Engine (Legal & Governance)
The Mechanism: A global regulatory heatmap utilizing Z-Score Anomaly Detection to flag unfair pricing deltas between Amazon Basics and 3rd-party sellers.

Business Impact: Provides a "Legal Shield" by ensuring marketplace neutrality is backed by auditable data telemetry.

Metric Tracked: Marketplace Parity Delta (%).

📈 Technical Stack & Architecture
Analytics: Predictive time-series forecasting (Revenue Yields) and Anomaly Detection (Regulatory Risk).
